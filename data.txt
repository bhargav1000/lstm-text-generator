Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting. Different regression models differ based on â€“ the kind of relationship between dependent and independent variables, they are considering and the number of independent variables being used. Linear regression performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent variable (x). So, this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between x (input) and y(output). Hence, the name is Linear Regression. In the figure above, X (input) is the work experience and Y (output) is the salary of a person. The regression line is the best fit line for our model. The Keras library provides a way to calculate and report on a suite of standard metrics when training deep learning models. In addition to offering standard metrics for classification and regression problems, Keras also allows you to define and report on your own custom metrics when training deep learning models. This is particularly useful if you want to keep track of a performance measure that better captures the skill of your model during training. In this tutorial, you will discover how to use the built-in metrics and how to define and use your own metrics when training deep learning models in Keras.
